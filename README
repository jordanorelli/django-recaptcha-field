Makes adding reCAPTCHA fields to Django forms easy.

Installation:

First, make sure you have the recaptcha-client library installed:

    pip install recaptcha-client

(or)

    easy_install recaptcha-client


Once the library is installed, set your reCAPTCHA public and private keys in your Django project's settings.py file.  You will want to use the keys *RECAPTCHA_PUBLIC_KEY* and *RECAPTCHA_PRIVATE_KEY* for this.

The default error messages I wrote are pretty flavorless.  You can change these by creating a *RECAPTCHA_ERROR_MESSAGES* dictionary in your settings.py file.  The error message keys are as follows:

invalid-site-private-key:  We weren't able to verify the private key.
invalid-request-cookie: The challenge parameter of the verify script was incorrect.
incorrect-captcha-sol: The CAPTCHA solution was incorrect.
recaptcha-not-reachable: The Django server was unable to reach the reCAPTCHA server.

This has been tested against recaptcha-client version 1.0.6 and Django 1.3.
